# LizardFS

LizardFS makes files secure by keeping all the data in multiple replicas spread over the available servers. This storage is presented to the end-user as a single logical namespace. It can also be used to build space-efficient storage because it is designed to run on commodity hardware. It has applications in multiple fields and is used by institutions in finance, telecommunications, medicine, education, post-production, game development, cloud hosting services, and others.
